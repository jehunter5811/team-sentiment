## Team Sentiment

A simple application to grab the most recent 100 tweets about any given team and analyze the sentiment from those tweets. 

Built with Next.js, Twitter API, and Parallel Dots API.

If you'd like to use an example response from the Parallel Dots API, there is a file in the root directory called `sentiment.json`. You can read from that, but you lose out on all the fun!
